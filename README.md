# 2048_flight

A simple 2048 game software written in Java. Developed while I was so bored on flights without wifi.

`javac Main.java ; java Main` in the directory to start the game in Terminal and follow the in-game instructions to play.

Current features:
- Customizable game board dimensions
- Customizable game goals
- Win/Loss indication when game ends

Stay tuned for possible future development: 
- Add a GUI
- Customizable game pieces
- New piece maneuver like piece teleporting and board flipping
- Reversing moves
- AI player for the game

**Enjoy!**
